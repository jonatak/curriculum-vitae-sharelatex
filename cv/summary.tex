I am an experienced software developer with 7 years of experience using mainly Java and Python, with strong skills in architecture and conception.
I start using Scala 2 years ago and fell in love with functional programming, I started using it more and more, and looked deeper in functional programming and other languages like Haskell to have a better understanding of all the concepts in functional programming that were new to me at that time.
I want to keep learning and improving with functional programming and its different applications and I'm looking forward to working in New Zealand in a new environment.
